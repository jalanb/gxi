gxi provides command-line menus for staging files

2 initial applications are provided:
* `gsi` offers options to view diffs, add, commit, drop, ... files
* `gvi` is similar, but uses vim for more operations

gxi is written in Python, but is an adaptation from an original [bash script here](https://github.com/jalanb/jab/blob/__main__/src/bash/git/gsi.sh).
